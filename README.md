# 📝 Blog Articles Web App

This is a simple blog article listing web application built with **React** and **Chakra UI**. It allows users to browse, search, sort, and view individual article details.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite)
- **Chakra UI** – for UI styling and layout
- **React Router** – for navigation and routing
- **Mock API** – simulated backend response
- **React Icons** – for iconography

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔍 Search articles by title
- 🗂️ Sort articles by publish date (ascending/descending)
- 📄 Paginate through the article list
- 📘 View full article details
- 🧭 Shared layout with a navigation menu

---

## 🚫 Limitations

- ❌ **Not responsive** – the layout is currently optimized for desktop use only.
- ❌ No real backend integration – all data is fetched from a mock service.
- ❌ No like/bookmark/comment features (yet).
